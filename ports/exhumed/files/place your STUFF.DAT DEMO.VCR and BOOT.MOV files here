Recommended (but optional) - Add the games CD audio tracks as OGG files in the format exhumedXX.ogg or trackXX.ogg (where XX is the track number) to the same folder as pcexhumed.exe. The game includes tracks 02 to 19. These will provide the game with its music soundtrack and add storyline narration by the King Ramses NPC.
